Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko[Note a][5] (Ukrainian: Тарас Григорович Шевченко [tɐˈrɑz ɦrɪˈɦɔrowɪtʃ ʃeu̯ˈtʃɛnko],
pronounced [tɐˈrɑs] without the middle name; 9 March [O.S. 25 February] 1814 – 10 March [O.S. 26 February] 1861),
also known as Kobzar Taras, or simply Kobzar (a kobzar is a bard in Ukrainian culture), was a Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, public and political figure,
folklorist and ethnographer.[4][6][7] His literary heritage is regarded to be the foundation of modern Ukrainian literature and, to a large extent,
the modern Ukrainian language, though this is different from the language of his poems. He also wrote some works in Russian (nine novellas, a diary,
and an autobiography).[2] Shevchenko is also known for his many masterpieces as a painter and an illustrator.[6]

He was a fellow of the Imperial Academy of Arts. Though he had never been a member of the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius,
Shevchenko was convicted in 1847 of explicitly promoting the independence of Ukraine,
writing poems in the Ukrainian language and ridiculing members of the Russian Imperial House.
Contrary to the members of the society who did not understand that their activity led to the idea of an independent Ukraine,
according to the secret police, he was a champion of independence.
